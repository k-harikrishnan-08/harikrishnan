JavaScript is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages.it is responsible for adding functionality to a website and  allows for user interaction with the website's content.

variables :
               var a=10;
               var b=20;
               console.log(a+b);          
                 
**3 types in variables:**
1. **var** ----global variable
2. **let**-----local variable
3. **const**--constant variable / can't manipulate the value

increment / decrement :
	 1. pre                 ---- >    a=10        a=  ++a     ----- (a is 10 change into 11)                   pre-increment ---- when next **a** is comes, the value is 11.
	 2. post               ---- >    b=10        b=  a--     ----- (b is 10 not change at this moment) post-increment----when  next **b**  is comes, at the moment the value change into 9 . after next b like **console.log(b)** in this b print the 9 value.

post for example:                      a=20;    // value of a is 20
						   console.log(a++); it will print 10 , after that value of a is change into **21** .

Datatypes :

| primitive | non-primitive |
| ---- | ---- |
| number | object |
| String | array |
| Boolean |  |
| Null |  |
| Undefined |  |

**Functions:**
a JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task .
function is executed when the function name (call it).

**If else :** 
- Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use `else` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use `switch` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

**loop :** 
	**for loop :** for loop is control flow statement used to repeatedly execute block of code on a specific condition.
example:
		for(initialization **;** condition **;** iteration)**{**
        code to be executed in each iteration **}**
	**While loop :**
